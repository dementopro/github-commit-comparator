### Post Assignment Answers:

**Major Design/Build Decisions:**
I focused on adhering to best coding conventions for clarity and readability, implementing the chosen chart library displayed in Figma. The goal was to keep the project simple and accessible to others.

**Time Spent on the Assignment:**
I dedicated approximately 7-8 hours to the project. This time was distributed across various tasks, including research (1-2 hours), frontend development and logic implementation (3-4 hours), and refining the codebase (remaining time).

**Advice to Myself:**
Given the chance to go back, I would advise myself to conduct more in-depth research on APIs. Discovering API rate limits later in the project hindered continuous development and could have been mitigated with prior knowledge.

**Learnings:**
Working on this assignment allowed me to explore the Recharts library for the first time and develop logic for merging data sets from multiple repositories. It was a valuable learning experience.

**Showcasing Abilities:**
The assignment provided a good opportunity to showcase frontend development skills, particularly in React and chart visualization. However, additional features and more time would have allowed for a more comprehensive demonstration.

**Unused Skills:**
While the assignment focused on frontend development, my broader web development skills include backend work with databases, integrating services like Redis and RabbitMQ, and deploying applications. Additionally, experience with CI/CD and writing test cases was not directly applied in this exercise.
