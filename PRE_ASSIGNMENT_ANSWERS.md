# Areas of Risk:

## 1. Public API Stability:
   - **Risk:** The project heavily relies on the stability of the public GitHub API. Any unforeseen changes or disruptions to this API could impact the app's functionality.
   - **Mitigation:** Regularly monitor GitHub's official channels for updates and maintain a flexible codebase to adapt quickly to API changes.

## 2. Future API Changes:
   - **Risk:** GitHub might introduce changes to their API in the future. Adapting to these changes promptly is essential to maintain the app's functionality.
   - **Mitigation:** Stay informed about GitHub's API updates, participate in relevant developer communities, and be prepared to adjust the app accordingly.

# Changes/Additions to Design:

## 1. Multiple Chart Types:
   - Provide users with the option to choose from multiple types of charts (e.g., line chart, bar chart) for visualizing commit activity. This would cater to different user preferences.

## 2. Author Information:
   - Display additional information about authors involved in the commits, such as their GitHub usernames and contribution statistics. This could enhance the user's understanding of the project's contributors.

## 3. Additional Insights:
   - Incorporate features that provide more insights into repository health, such as code quality metrics, recent issues, or pull request statistics. This would offer a more comprehensive overview for users.

## 4. Caching Mechanism:
   - Implement a caching mechanism, such as Redis, to avoid unnecessary repeated API calls. Caching would enhance performance and reduce the load on the GitHub API.

## 5. GitHub Account Integration:
   - Allow users to log in with their GitHub accounts to access and visualize commit data from their private repositories. This feature would provide a more personalized experience for users with private projects.

**Note:** The GitHub API has limitations on the number of requests allowed. To address this, the app currently fetches data for the current year only, considering GitHub's maximum page size for commits (limited to 100). This limitation ensures the app can handle repositories with a large number of commits while staying within API rate limits.

## Additional Considerations:

### 6. User Notifications:
   - Implement a notification system to alert users about API rate limits or any disruptions in data fetching. This way, users are informed if there are issues accessing data due to API constraints.

### 7. Pagination Handling:
   - As the GitHub API has a maximum page size for commits, ensure robust handling of pagination. Implement an efficient mechanism to retrieve and display data across multiple pages without compromising performance.

### 8. Error Handling and Logging:
   - Develop a robust error handling mechanism to gracefully handle failures, such as network issues or unexpected API responses. Implement logging to capture relevant information for debugging and troubleshooting.

Remember to keep monitoring GitHub's API changes and consider implementing automated tests to validate your application's compatibility with the latest API versions. Overall, your approach demonstrates a proactive stance toward potential challenges and a commitment to improving the application over time.
